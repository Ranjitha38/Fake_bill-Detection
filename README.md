# Fake_bill-Detection
classification of fake bills vs genuine bills
To achieve this 
- Predicted the missing values with a linear regression and added the values in dataset
- Compared classification such as logistic regression with an unsupervised model such as K-Means to predict the authenticity of the bills
- Tried to do a PCA or a Kernel Transform to create a clearer separation between the Genuine and Fake Bills
